### 9/1/15
- Daniel:
  - PHP project:
    - visual details need to more closely match the example: font sizes & title spelling
    - header is missing on some pages. On view.php it is above the doctype
    - products.php needs to be included on browse, view is good
- Daniel:
  - php project is done
  - css project: needs better seperation of layout and components
  
### 9/2/15

  - did good, struggled a little on nesting if statements appropriately, which caused errors as well, but got there.
