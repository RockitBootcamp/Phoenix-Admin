- Kris: Project, passed
  - Did good, his project was clean and didn't have things repeated. He did have trouble on how to explain what certain lines were doing. He understood what was happening, but explaining with correct verbiage was where he struggled, so we went over some different things with that. 

### Reviews: 4/21/15

- Brad: Interview started with HTML. He did good for the first part but needs to study how to use the label tag, checkboxes, and he messed up a select input pretty bad.

- *HTML* did well with forms this time, no struggles
- *CSS* did good here, struggled with media object and adding `overflow: hidden` to the parent container, but got to it
- *PHP* did good up until if statements and loops, so we broke away into a lesson with Mark for much of the day. When we came back to it, he passed.

### Reviews 5/11/15
- Kris: Interview, passed
  - He did better this time. He thinks too much into things and confuses himself. There were examples where he would say he wasn't sure, and I'd look over and he would have it exactly right. Needs to work on not second guessing himself
