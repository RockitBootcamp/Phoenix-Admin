# Jenna Connolly

## Individual Study Notes, Toolsm, & Practices
- Flow Charts:
  - Jenna really like flow-charts and they seem to be very helpful for her
  - she has a tendency to mix levels of abstraction or levels of logic. For example:
    - while working on the logic for validating page inputs she will start including logic for higher level page flow logic
  - I've worked with her to focus on one level at a time, possibly creating several flow charts at different level of detail
- She gets really concerned about vocabulary, so it might be helpful to help her create a vocab list for a difficult lesson.
- She is constantly worried about getting behind and missing lessons. I've been reiterating that as long as she is concentrating on her task at the moment, we (the instructors) will make sure that she gets all of the lessons she needs.


## M1

- [x] Project
- [x] Interview
- [x] Test Score: 70.7%

### Reviews: 4/10/15
- Brad: Just needs to clean up a few things on the project

- Kris: Went through interview with her, she did okay, but did not pass. Areas to study: 
  - HTML/CSS - descendants, specificity, optimizing selectors, selecting different tags (Span with "One" inside of it), 
  - PHP - concatenate and variable interpolation, data types (explaining it), and type casting (we didn't get to this).
  - UNIX - did great here. Only struggled with remembering mv command
  - did not get to Local Environment or Git

- Daniel:
  - Project done. Had one alignment problem. Fixed it.
  - Started another tech interview after class, but it turned into a tutorial session. She did well enough on the html/css parts but was still having trouble with types and type casting so we did several different exercises examining types.

- **4/13/15**
  - Kris: Interview passed
    - finished PHP, she did good with type casting. Struggled a little on remembering include and include_once, but we weren't requiring that for this round
    - finished Unix by going over how to rename a file
    - HTTP Concepts - did good. Understands, but has trouble explaining with the right verbiage
    - Local enironment - did good here, went through steps her own 
    - Git - did good here as well.

### Reviews: 4/22/15
- Kris: 
  - Interview, not passed
    - *HTML* - passed
    - *CSS* - needs to go over how to explain collapsing margins a little better, explain difference between CSS reset and CSS normalize, and needs to do media object and we did not get to the selectors.
    - *PHP* - needs to study loops, passed everything else
- Brad: Interview/css - did well with the first half, didn't do well with media objects, floats, clearing. Next interview, go fast through the first few questions, make her do a proper media object

    - absolute position - how it changes flow
  - PHP
    - creating functions - she wanted to pass in variables on a function that just output a message
    - did good on creating function with parameters that added those parameters together, and also with all other parts of php. was a little slow on calling the parent::__construct().
    - needs to study try/catch
    - importance of client and server side validation
    - needs to work on explaining sessions, what it is and creating a "logged in" state
    - preg_match()
  - JS, need to review:
    - implicit type casting
    - primitive data types

### Reviews 5/7/15
- Kris: Interview - passed
  - did better and definitely studied. Still a little weak on explaining client-side validation, but good enough to move forward. 

### Reviews 5/12/15
