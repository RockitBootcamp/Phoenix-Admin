- Daniel: Project looked good. He didn't catch the "wrong product id" case, but once I mentioned it he fixed it before I had a chance to send him away. 
- Brad: Interview - he passed the HTML/CSS part. He was doing well with PHP until we got to the string part. That's where he needs to pick up on the next interview

- **4/13/15**
  - Kris: Interview - 
    - PHP - started with the string part, and he did well. Struggled some on how to explain type casting, but has it.
    - Unix - did great here
    - Local Environment - did great here, went through all steps quickly with no help
    - HTTP Concepts - did well here, had a little trouble how to explain some things, but has the understanding
    - Git - did great here, added everything using the terminal and was quick
    - **feedback** - Work on explaining different areas better. Suggested he use blog time as practice to write as though he is explaining some of the different things to someone else.

- Kris: Project, passed
  - project looked good, there was some lack of spacing around operators, but was fixed on the spot. 
  - Also had to change logic to be equal to "Mac" instead of "0"; fixed that on the spot with some guidance.

- Kris: Inteview, didn't finish
- *HTML* - needs to review value attribute for checkboxes, dropdowns, and input w/type button
- *CSS* - needs to review child-parent collapsing margins and how to prevent collapsing margins, couldn't remember "box-sizing", didn't get any further 

### Reviews: 4/21/15
- Kris: Interview, didn't pass
  - *HTML, CSS, GIT* - passed, did good with what value attributes are used for with each input
  - *PHP* - needs to go over loops still. He struggled with the first one, so having him study all. Also struggled with how to add new value to already created arrays.
