# Mark Nichols

## Study Plan
### Thurs, Apr 23rd
- Kris: Mark was still struggling with the logic of PHP and he hadn't interviewed yet, so I spent quite a bit of time with him going over `if` statements and loops. Gave him the following homework assignment:
  - Create a form that has the following fields: First Name, Last Name (make this required), option of adult or child, drop down with three cities, a group of three colors for the user to select which ones he/she likes, and a submit button. If the user selects "adult," output a message that reads, "Hello [first and last name], you are an adult." Otherwise output, "Hello [first and last name], you are a child."

### Fri, Apr 24th
- Kris: spent about 1/2 the day with Mark 1:1. 
  - We went through the homework, and he got it to work correctly, but his logic was not correct. He was checking to see if `$_GET['submit']` exists, then if it did, he assiged the `$_GET['age']` to a new variable and did the rest correctly to determine if "adult" or "child" was provided. We went through step by step where I asked questions to get him thinking about each part. 
  - After first attempt at interview (see notes below), we went through CSS media object and collapsing margins, then we did lesson and practice on `if` statements and loops. We spent about 3 hours on this and then he did the interview again
  - His study plan was to:
    - update his trello to organize what he needs to do
    - take an hour and practice `if` statements and loops (`for` and `foreach`)
    - take at least hour and go over functions
    - watch Brad's PHP OOP video (40 min long)
    - Told him to update his study plan and that he should be spending much more than 3 hours, but that is a start.

### Reviews: 4/10/15
- Kris: Interview, not passed
  - **HTML/CSS** - nesting, attributes, took a long time getting the right selectors
  - Didn't get to any of the other topics
  - Helped him understand a few HTML things, also gave some feedback that he needs to work on *listening* when others are explaining to him because he has the tendency to jump ahead and not be right. 
  - Gave him some homework to go through the different lessons we had this week through github and read each area. Told him to write down any questions he has and let him know I'd be here early on Monday to go over things with him. Right now he is behind, but he has the desire to get it and was receptive to my feedback

### Reviews: 4/13/15
- Kris: Reviewed project, looked good, passed. Suggested one small thing to not repeat one piece of css. Also had him add one more piece on the `if` and `if else` to account for anything other than 1,2,3 product. He did that without help.

### Reviews: 4/14/15
- Kris: Interview, not passed
  - **HTML/CSS** - spent quite a bit of time here. He was getting some things mixed around, so it turned into more of a lesson than interview. He was mixing up the order of CSS selectors, and we went over nesting and the difference of what the indentation is for versus actual nesting within elements. 

### Reviews: 4/15/15
- Kris: Interview, not finished - still needs to pass HTML/CSS and PHP
  - **HTTP Concepts** - did good here, had trouble explaining with the right verbiage, so helped him with that, but he got the concept
  - **Localhost Environment** - went through all the steps, first time he missed updating the .conf file, so I guided him to correct it. Once he went into it, he knew what to change, but when I asked why he changes it, his explanation was off, so I helped him with that.
  - **Unix** - did good here, only forgot the 'touch' command to make a new file, but did it using nano and adding to the file
  - **Git** - did good here
  - **PHP** - started here, he somewhat struggled with getting syntax right for creating a variable that held the sum of two variables, so this turned into somewhat of a lesson to help understand the purpose of variables and how to properly use the assignment operator. We went into if statements, which he struggled with the syntax and we ran out of time. 

### Reviews: 4/15/15

### Reviews: 4/16/15
-Kris: Interview, passed
  - **PHP** - did some extra practice doing katas; He passed the interview. I'm using some different techniques to help him understand some of the things we are doing, and it seems to be sticking for him.

### Reviews 4/22/15
- Kris: Project, passed
  - Project looked good, there were some formatting things to correct, which he did on the spot. He also needed to correct his if statement for the order of more than 7 macs. He was using idex == 0 as opposed to getting the value and checking to see if it was == "Macbook". He changed that on the spot, took awhile, but he got it. I also had him explain to me what was happening with each line of code so that he could gain a better understanding of what was happening with each piece. 
  - *Feedback to Mark* - told him to look at each objective and, if he wasn't able to explain it, to write it down. Then after he's looked at each one, go one by one down the list and study the material more and google, if necessary.
