### 6/15/15

- Brig: Reviewed project. Looked good. Shared he had difficultly getting the logic and variable concepts.
- Brig: Interview: Struggled explaining block and inline. Struggled coding nested html. Struggled with sibling element. Didn't know about title attribute. Really threw him. Suggested he change his study method. (Create flash cards, get a study partner and review objectives)

- Kris: Interview, passed.
  - struggled a little on the basic logic for php, but got there and had him do some more.
