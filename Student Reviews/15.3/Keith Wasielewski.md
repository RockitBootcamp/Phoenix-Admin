### 6/30/15
- Kris: Twitter project, passed. 
  - he did good, used .siblings() in some areas instead of moving up to parents() and going back down. Also had one area in renderTweet that he was using a lot of variables, which made it somewhat difficult to read, so discussed with him and he cleaned it up.
