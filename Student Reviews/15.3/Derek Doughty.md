- Kris: Interview, passed
  - he still struggled some on the callback functions, but did get it. Gave him suggestion of doing katas, but before erasing and re-doing, told him to say out loud what is happening on each line so he has a better idea of what is being done and not just memorizing things. He liked that idea. Also talked about re-doing projects that use areas he is struggling.
