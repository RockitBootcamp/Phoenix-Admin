- Kris: He had to update some css to be dry, but he did that right away. Project passed; he did good. 
- Brad: Interview, has to work on PHP Logic, passed everything else
- Kevin: Still struggling with logic, did some tutoring with him an he's starting to grasp it better. He's going to work on it over the weekend and try again Monday.
