### 9/24/2015

- Kevin Interview:
  - Andrew didn't study at all, still giving the exact wrong answers as before, having him pair up with another student to study, as it seems solo study is not benefitting him

### 9/29/2015

- He passed the HTML and CSS, although a little weaker than I would really want. But he did seem to get the right answers or about 99% right. On PHP, he did well with variable types and operators, but not Logic or Strings

### 9/30/2015

- Interview:
  - syntax was completely wrong (missing brackes, invalid operators, etc), still needs to study very basic syntax
  - told him to go write `if`/`else if` statements that have nothing in it for starters (`if () {}` etc) before practicing conditional statements, make sure he knows the syntax so well he can do it blindfolded

### 10/05/2015

- Interview (Brig):
  -   Passed PHP. Had trouble with the nested Ifs.
