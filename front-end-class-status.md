## Notes Topics to be considered

Node / Express
- Kevin: I think this would be a great topic, but I think unless the class is sort of centered around this approach (sort of like the LAMP class) then it might not be that helpful. Would be great for a "Full-Stack" or "Isomorphic" focused class (JavaScript top to bottom)

Advanced Sass topics
Twitter BS

BEM?

HTML5 BP


React / Angular

ES5,6 / DOM

Coffeescript

Web Components
- Kevin: Heck yeah!

APIs / Third party code
    Google Maps
    jQuery Knob
    Animate.css
    jQuery UI

JSLint

Unit Testing

Revealing Module Pattern
Event Emitter Patterns (pubsub)
