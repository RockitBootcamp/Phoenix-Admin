## Notes Topics to be considered

Node / Express
- Kevin: I think this would be a great topic, but I think unless the class is sort of centered around this approach (sort of like the LAMP class) then it might not be that helpful. Would be great for a "Full-Stack" or "Isomorphic" focused class (JavaScript top to bottom)

Advanced Sass topics

BEM?

HTML5 BP


React / Angular

ES5,6 / DOM

Coffeescript
