# DOM CRUD Acid Test

Students should be able to create, retrieve, update, and delete DOM, (the CRUD of DOM) with plain JavaScript and jQuery before they can move ahead to learn frameworks like Backbone, Angular, or even tools like Handlebars. This exercise should be conducted by a teacher where the students are asked to work individually without helping each other. This will allow the teacher to discover which students are struggling with knowing how to put verbal instructions into code.

## Exercise Overview

This exercise will ask students to create list items dynamically with arrays and loops. Then the students will create click events for the list items to retrieve data from the DOM and from the initial data source that made the list items.

## Tasks

The following instructions are meant to be read to the students.

### Create a data source

Create an array of user objects. Each user should have a name, an age, and an occupation:

Solution 1:
```js
var users = [
    {
        name: 'Dave',
        age: 33,
        occupation: 'Web Designer'
    },
    {
        name: 'Sally',
        age: 34,
        occupation: 'Art Director'
    },
    {
        name: 'Mike',
        age: 35,
        occupation: 'Musician'
    }
];
```

Solution 2:
```js
var users = [];


```
